- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?

In House class:
1. I chose to overload the constructor and remove the number of floors because there are many houses that only have one floor. To get to this, I also eliminated the possibility of an elevator and a dining room because these are not features of every house either, especially houses that are not on college campuses. 
2. I chose to overload the method isResident() to allow us to check whether 2 residents live in a specific house, as opposed to just one. To do this, I added a parameter for the second resident called person2. I did this because sometimes we may want, in real life for example, to figure out if a couple or pair of friends live in the same house, or if two people live in the same house. 

In Library class:
1. I chose to overload the constructor here because not all libraries have elevators or more than 1 floor, therefore, it may be useful for some to not have to input the number of floors or whether they have an elevator if their standard is just 1 floor without an elevator. 
2. I also chose to overload the method of checkOut() because I wanted the user of the library to be able to check out more than 1 book, in this case 2 books, at a time. I also changed the method printCollection() to reflect this. 

In the Cafe class:
1. I chose to overload the constructor because as we talked about during class, not all cafes have more than one floor. Most cafes only have 1 floor that is accessible to customers or 1 floor in total, so the int nFloors parameter may not always be useful.
2. I also chose to overload the sellCoffee() method because the original method took in 3 parameters, int size, int nSugarPackets, int nCreams, however, I believe that the most important of these parameters is int size. Not all customers ask for a specific number of sugar packets or creams, so there should be a standard amount of each that is referred to just in case depending on the type of drink that the customer orders. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Going to tutoring hours definitely helped with this assignment, as well as being open to trial and error. For me, it's so important to just try different things out sometimes and learn to accept my effort even if they don't work out. It's okay to have to comment out code and even have to delete a lot of it, which may suck sometimes but is such a crucial part of improving in coding.
